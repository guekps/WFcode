<h1>Hello, I am GPS</h1>

<p>
Guek Peng Siong, or GPS as some of his friends call him, has nearly 30 years of experience in photography. His love for the art started in the 1980s, when he first cradled in his hands the Minolta Dynax 300i, a camera that was state of the art in its times. Little did he know then that photography was to be a lifelong passion whose flame continues to burn brightly today.
